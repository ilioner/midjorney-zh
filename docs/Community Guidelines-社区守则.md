## 备注

### 血腥或者不适的内容包含那些?

人或动物的身体分离部位的图像、食人、血腥、暴力（例如射击或炸弹爆炸的图像）、畸形身体、截肢、瘟疫等。

### What's NSFW or Adult Content?

Avoid nudity, sexual organs, fixation on naked breasts, people in showers or on toilets, sexual imagery, fetishes, etc.

### Other Offensive Content

Other things may be deemed offensive or abusive because they can be viewed as racist, homophobic, disturbing, or in some way derogatory to a community. This includes naked children and offensive images of celebrities or public figures. Content guidelines are continually reviewed and may be modified as the Midjourney community grows.

## Automatically Banned Keywords

Finding a balance between facilitating artistic expression and creating a safe and welcoming community for a broad group of users is challenging. Everyone has a right to an opinion about what images are beautiful, intriguing, or inspiring, and there are as many individual interpretations of what content is offensive, inappropriate, or harmful. We also recognize that art has a long history of pushing the status quo to challenge social conventions, inspire discussion, and spark change.

When deciding on our community guidelines for Midjourney, we considered many factors. As a new and rapidly developing technology, it is important to consider how the broader public will perceive and be introduced to this technology. Midjourney is a more participatory image-making tool than a paintbrush or pencil. The Midjourney team does not wish to participate in creating pornographic, offensive, or harmful images. Most important, however, was our desire to create a welcoming and inclusive community for all users. To that end, we have established guidelines prohibiting certain behaviors and language on our platform. One aspect of these guidelines is banning words and phrases that have been used in harmful or offensive ways toward members of our community.

We understand that the balance we decided on and the decision to ban certain words may not be popular with everyone. Still, we hope you will respect our efforts to create a positive and supportive community for all. We encourage you to express yourself creatively but to do so in a way that is respectful and considerate of others.

### Why is _This_ Word Banned?

Some words and phrases are banned because they produce content that is widely considered inappropriate, offensive, or harmful. Some banned words seem safe but consistently produce images that violate the content guidelines.

Remember that the Midjourney Bot does not understand language the way a human does. For example, the peach emoji 🍑 is currently a banned word, and the prompt, "beautiful 🍑 orchard" would trigger the banned word filter. No one thinks a beautiful orchard of peach trees is offensive or not safe to view at work. However, the 🍑 emoji is also common slang for butts and is often associated with pictures that are NSFW so the actual results of prompting a "beautiful 🍑 orchard" are more problematic than you would initially think.

Users who repeatedly violate the terms of service may be warned by a community moderator, given a time-out from accessing the bot, or be blocked from the service.

## Self-Policing and Reporting

Occasionally prompts will unintentionally produce non-PG-13 content. Please self-police these images by using the ❌ emoji reaction or by **right-clicking** selecting **Apps** and then clicking `Cancel Job` to delete the image.

Users may flag any image for moderator review by **right-clicking** selecting **Apps**, and then clicking `Report Job` within discord or the website by selecting `...` under an image and clicking `Report`.
