Find a Job ID
-------------

Job IDs are unique identifiers used for each image generated by Midjourney.  
Job IDs look like this: `9333dcd0-681e-4840-a29c-801e502ae424`and can be found in the first part of all image filenames, in the URLs on the website, and in an image's filename.

### On The Web

You can find the Job ID of any image in your member gallery by selecting `...` > `Copy...` > `Job ID`.
